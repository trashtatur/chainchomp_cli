# Chainchomp CLI

Central CLI for Chainchomp and its related libraries. This is primarily the endpoint for user interaction but 
it is also needed to set up some basic infrastructure that other parts of chainchomp rely on. That is
primarily handled by running the ``setup`` command. The rest of the commands just provide the user with a standardized
way to interact with the application.
